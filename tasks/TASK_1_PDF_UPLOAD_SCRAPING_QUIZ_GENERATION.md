# TASK_1_PDF_UPLOAD_SCRAPING_QUIZ_GENERATION

## Overview
Implement a complete PDF processing system that allows users to upload PDF files, extract text content through scraping, and prepare the extracted text for quiz generation via LLM endpoints.

## Requirements

### Core Functionality
1. **PDF Upload System**
   - Accept PDF file uploads through a web interface
   - Validate file format and size constraints
   - Handle multiple file uploads if needed
   - Provide user feedback during upload process

2. **PDF Text Extraction**
   - Implement PDF scraping/text extraction functionality
   - Support various PDF formats and layouts
   - Handle text from different sections (headers, paragraphs, tables, etc.)
   - Preserve text structure and formatting where relevant for quiz generation

3. **Text Processing & Storage**
   - Clean and normalize extracted text
   - Store processed text in appropriate variables/data structures
   - Handle large documents efficiently
   - Provide text preview functionality

4. **Quiz Generation Integration**
   - Format extracted text for LLM consumption
   - Include context about quiz generation requirements
   - Prepare prompts that describe:
     - Number of questions desired
     - Question types (multiple choice, true/false, short answer)
     - Difficulty level
     - Topic focus areas
     - Answer format requirements

### Technical Specifications

#### Backend Requirements
- PDF parsing library (e.g., PyPDF2, pdfplumber, or similar)
- File upload handling with proper validation
- Text preprocessing and cleaning utilities
- LLM integration endpoints
- Error handling and logging

#### Frontend Requirements
- File upload interface with drag-and-drop support
- Progress indicators for upload and processing
- Text preview functionality
- Quiz generation trigger interface
- Error message display

#### Data Flow
1. User uploads PDF file(s)
2. System validates and stores uploaded files
3. PDF text extraction process runs
4. Extracted text is cleaned and processed
5. Text is formatted with quiz generation context
6. Prepared content is sent to LLM endpoint
7. Quiz questions are generated and returned

### Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can successfully upload PDF files
- [ ] Text is accurately extracted from various PDF formats
- [ ] Extracted text is properly formatted for quiz generation
- [ ] System handles errors gracefully (corrupted files, unsupported formats)
- [ ] LLM receives well-structured prompts with clear quiz requirements
- [ ] Generated quizzes are relevant to the source material

### Technical Considerations
- Memory management for large PDF files
- Processing time optimization
- Support for PDFs with images, tables, and complex layouts
- Security considerations for file uploads
- Scalability for multiple concurrent uploads

### Future Enhancements
- Support for additional document formats (Word, text files)
- Batch processing capabilities
- Advanced text analysis for better quiz generation
- User preferences for quiz customization
- Integration with existing user management systems

## Implementation Priority
**High** - This is a core feature for the quiz generation system and should be implemented early in the development cycle.

## Dependencies
- PDF processing libraries
- File upload handling system
- LLM API integration
- Frontend framework for user interface
- Database/storage system for processed text
