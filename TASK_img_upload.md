# Image Upload and Save Task

## Overview
Implement a complete image upload and save functionality that allows users to upload images, validate them, and store them securely on the server.

## Task Breakdown

### 1. Frontend Image Upload Component
- [ ] Create image upload form with drag-and-drop support
- [ ] Add file type validation (JPEG, PNG, GIF, WebP)
- [ ] Implement file size validation (max 10MB)
- [ ] Add image preview functionality
- [ ] Include progress indicator for upload status
- [ ] Handle multiple file selection
- [ ] Add image compression/resizing options

### 2. Backend API Endpoints
- [ ] Create POST endpoint for image upload (`/api/upload/image`)
- [ ] Implement file validation on server side
- [ ] Add security checks (file type verification, malware scanning)
- [ ] Create GET endpoint to retrieve uploaded images (`/api/images/:id`)
- [ ] Add DELETE endpoint for image removal (`/api/images/:id`)
- [ ] Implement image metadata storage

### 3. File Storage System
- [ ] Set up local file storage directory structure
- [ ] Implement cloud storage integration (AWS S3, Google Cloud, etc.)
- [ ] Add file naming convention (UUID-based naming)
- [ ] Create backup and redundancy system
- [ ] Implement file cleanup for orphaned uploads

### 4. Database Schema
- [ ] Design image metadata table
- [ ] Store file paths, sizes, dimensions, upload dates
- [ ] Add user association for uploaded images
- [ ] Implement soft delete functionality
- [ ] Add indexing for efficient queries

### 5. Security Implementation
- [ ] Validate file headers (not just extensions)
- [ ] Implement rate limiting for uploads
- [ ] Add CSRF protection
- [ ] Sanitize file names
- [ ] Implement access control and permissions
- [ ] Add virus scanning integration

### 6. Image Processing
- [ ] Generate multiple image sizes (thumbnails, medium, large)
- [ ] Implement image optimization
- [ ] Add watermarking functionality
- [ ] Create image format conversion
- [ ] Implement EXIF data handling

### 7. Error Handling
- [ ] Handle upload failures gracefully
- [ ] Implement retry mechanisms
- [ ] Add comprehensive error logging
- [ ] Create user-friendly error messages
- [ ] Handle network timeouts

### 8. Testing
- [ ] Unit tests for upload functionality
- [ ] Integration tests for API endpoints
- [ ] File validation tests
- [ ] Security vulnerability tests
- [ ] Performance testing for large files

### 9. Documentation
- [ ] API documentation for upload endpoints
- [ ] User guide for image upload process
- [ ] Configuration documentation
- [ ] Troubleshooting guide

## Technical Requirements

### Frontend Technologies
- HTML5 File API
- JavaScript/TypeScript
- CSS for styling and animations
- Framework: React/Vue/Angular (as applicable)

### Backend Technologies
- Node.js/Express or Python/Flask/Django
- Multer (Node.js) or similar for file handling
- Sharp or ImageMagick for image processing
- Database: PostgreSQL/MySQL/MongoDB

### Security Considerations
- File type validation using magic numbers
- Size limits and timeout handling
- Secure file storage outside web root
- Input sanitization and validation
- HTTPS enforcement for uploads

## Success Criteria
- [ ] Users can upload images up to 10MB
- [ ] All common image formats are supported
- [ ] Upload progress is clearly indicated
- [ ] Images are stored securely and efficiently
- [ ] System handles concurrent uploads
- [ ] Error messages are user-friendly
- [ ] Performance is optimized for large files
- [ ] Security vulnerabilities are addressed

## Timeline
- **Week 1**: Frontend component and basic backend API
- **Week 2**: File storage and database integration
- **Week 3**: Security implementation and testing
- **Week 4**: Image processing and optimization

## Notes
- Consider implementing CDN integration for better performance
- Plan for scalability with cloud storage solutions
- Ensure GDPR compliance for user data handling
- Implement proper logging for audit trails
